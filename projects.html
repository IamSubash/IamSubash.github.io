	      <p class="abstract">The use of energy-harvesting technologies in mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN) delivers a promising opportunity to mitigate the limitations that irreplaceable energy sources impose over conventional MWSN. We propose Leontief-Data Cleaning Distribution Strategy (Leontief-DCD), an economic model-based method designed to distribute the data cleaning workload in energy harvesting MWSN powered by predictable energy sources, such as solar energy. Leontief-DCD creates interdependencies among sensor nodes to predict the required cooperation from each node in the data cleaning process. Different from existing task allocation methods, the interdependencies in Leontief-DCD allows for to plan a workload distribution that benefits the network as a whole, rather than only individual sensors, which consequently benefit the overall system performance. Our results show that when employing our method to distribute data cleaning workload in highly dirty, real-world datasets in scenarios with high and low energy, our method increased the number of data samples engaged in data cleaning processes by up to 25.57%, the count of active sensor nodes by up to 44.01%, and the network overall well-being by up to 55.42% compared to data cleaning performed by each node individually.</p>

            <p class="abstract">Hurricanes are cyclones circulating about a defined center whose closed wind speeds exceed 75 mph originating over tropical and subtropical waters. At landfall, hurricanes can result in severe disasters. The accuracy of predicting their tra- jectory paths is critical to reduce economic loss and save human lives. Given the complexity and nonlinearity of weather data, a recurrent neural network (RNN) could be beneficial in modeling hurricane behavior. We propose the application of a fully connected RNN to predict the trajectory of hurricanes. We employed the RNN over a fine grid to reduce typical truncation errors. We utilized their latitude, longitude, wind speed, and pressure publicly provided by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to predict the trajectory of a hurricane at 6-hour intervals. Results show that this proposed technique is competitive to methods currently employed by the NHC and can predict up to approximately 120 hours of hurricane path.</p>

              <p class="abstract">Recently, blockchain has received much attention from the mobility-centric Internet of Things (IoT). It is deemed the key to ensuring the built-in integrity of information and security of immutability by design in the peer-to-peer network (P2P) of mobile devices. In a permissioned blockchain, the authority of the system has control over the identities of its users. Such information can allow an ill-intentioned authority to map identities with their spatiotemporal data, which undermines the location privacy of a mobile user. In this paper, we study the location privacy preservation problem in the context of permissioned blockchain-based IoT systems under three conditions. First, the authority of the blockchain holds the public and private key distribution task in the system. Second, there exists a spatiotemporal correlation between consecutive location-based transactions. Third, users communicate with each other through short-range communication technologies such that it constitutes a proof of location (PoL) on their actual locations. We show that, in a permissioned blockchain with an authority and a presence of a PoL, existing approaches cannot be applied using a plug-and-play approach to protect location privacy. In this context, we propose BlockPriv, an obfuscation technique that quantifies, both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship between privacy and utility in order to dynamically protect the privacy of sensitive locations in the permissioned blockchain.</p>
